				<h3 class="subheading">Who I Am</h3>
				<p class="sub-descriptions"><img class="headshot" src="images/bgs/headshot.png" alt="ME!" width="60px"/>I am a 26 year old engineer and programmer with a passion for building cool things. The things I build don't necessarily help to save the world, but who knows, maybe someday they will. I have a strong drive to learn new things which often is the motivation for the projects I work on in my spare time. I am married to an awesome wife, have great friends and family, and am an all-around lucky guy.</p>

			<div class="three columns">
				<h3 class="subheading">What I Do</h3>
				<p class="sub-descriptions">I'm a Mechanical Engineer by day and by training (BSME UC Berkeley '08) and a web/mobile developer by night and lots of practice (self taught '06-pres. 3 apps in iOS app store). I work at <a href="http://www.diconfiberoptics.com">DiCon Fiberoptics Inc.</a> as a mechanical design engineer in their MEMS group designing passive optical components. My small app company, <a href="http://www.appott.com">Appott Apps</a> currently has 3 apps in the app store with more on the way soon.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="three columns">
				<h3 class="subheading">Where I Do It</h3>
				<p class="sub-descriptions">They tell me that for the first 6 months of my life I lived in Sacramento, CA. The earliest photographic/video evidence of my residence anywhere exists of me in the cozy Sacramento suburb of Fair Oaks where I lived until I graduated from high school. I then moved to Berkeley while I attended college. After college my wife and I moved to Alameda, CA just across the bay from San Francisco where we now live across the street from the "Beach" (you'd understand if you saw it).</p>

			<div class="three columns offset-by-one">
				<h3 class="subheading">When I Do It</h3>
				<p class="sub-descriptions">Pretty much all the time I guess... (doing a Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How is trickier than I thought) I work as a Mechanical Engineer during the day. I currently do my web/mobile development on nights and weekends.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="three columns">
				<h3 class="subheading">How I Do It</h3>
				<p class="sub-descriptions">Everyday I work in Solidworks 2010 and AutoCAD for engineering design. I have experience with ProE as well. For software development I use XCode4, Objective-C, C, Python, PHP, MySQL, Apache, HTML, and CSS. I use OSX, Windows, and Linux (Ubuntu Server) and spend a lot of time in a terminal. And of course, Word, Power Point, Excel, blah, blah, blah...
			</div>
			<div class="three columns">
				<h3 class="subheading">Why I Do It</h3>
				<p class="sub-descriptions">I kind of buried the lede here because the reason I do all this stuff is because I love it. There's a joy to creating something that you find fun or useful. It's even more enjoyable when others find it cool as well. I can't describe the feeling of the first time I read a comment from a user calling a game I made "addictive." That one comment sustained me through 6 months of development on new projects. The reason I love mechanical engineering is because it allows me to create something tangible and real. The reason I love software is because it allows me to create something rapidly and with few resources. The thing they share is the ability they give me to create.</p>
